				<h1>Dumping NAND to Emulated NAND (emuNAND)</h1>
				<hr />
				<div class="normal">
					Emulated NAND is just what you'd expect it to be: emulated NAND that
					can be used instead of your actual NAND. In this guide, you'll be
					dumping your actual NAND to be used as emuNAND.
				</div>
				<div class="notice--warning">
					Before dumping, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of
					your NAND using <a href="https://wii.guide/bootmii">BootMii</a>.
				</div>
				<h4>What you need</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://wii.guide/usbloadergx">USB Loader GX</a></li>
					<li>An SD card or a USB drive with at least 520 MB</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="notice--info">
					This guide will use the default paths set in USB Loader GX. You can
					edit the paths mentioned to your preference in the Custom Paths option
					found in the global settings of USB Loader GX.
				</div>
			</div>
			<h4>Instructions</h4>
			<div class="Section I">
				<h5>Section I - Preparing the SD Card</h5>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Create a folder on the root of your SD card named
						<code>nands</code> and then create a folder in the
						<code>nands</code> named <code>01</code>. At this point, your SD
						card should look something similar to the image below.
					</li>
					<img src="assets/emuNAND.png" width="796px" height="557px" />
					<li>
						Eject your SD card, insert it into your Wii and launch USB Loader
						GX.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="Section II">
				<h5>Section II - Dumping the NAND to the emuNAND</h5>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Select the gears icon near the bottom left corner of the screen to
						open Global Settings. Then select the option titled “Features”.
					</li>
					<li>
						Scroll down the page and select the option titled “Dump NAND to
						EmuNAND.” Select “Everything.”
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>
				You have now successfully dumped your NAND to your emuNAND. You can now
				use your emuNAND to store and install things just like you would your
				actual NAND.

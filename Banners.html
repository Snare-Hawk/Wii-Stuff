			<h1>Custom Wii Banners for USB Loader GX</h1>
			<hr />
			<div class="normal">
				This is a guide on how I was able to make custom banners for use in
				<a href="https://wii.guide/usbloadergx">USB Loader GX</a>. While it may
				not be the best way to do it, it is the one that I found to work. If you
				happened to have found a better method, ping me on the
				<a href="https://discord.gg/rc24">RiiConnect24 Discord server</a>, my
				username is Snare-Hawk#6331.

			<h4>What you need</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/customizemii/downloads">
						CustomizeMii
					</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					A WAD to use as a base, such as
					<a href="assets/Animal Crossing Banner.wad">
						this Animal Crossing one
					</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					An image editing software, such as
					<a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Optional</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					An audio editing software, such as
					<a href="http://www.darkaudacity.com/download.html">Dark Audacity</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Instructions</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Find or create a fitting image that you want to use as the banner art.
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						For a good banner, I recommend just putting the game's logo on top
						of the title's art in your editing software.
					</li>
					<li>For best results, ensure the image's aspect ratio is 16:9.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Compress the image as much as you can.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I've noticed that the larger the WAD is in size, the longer it takes
						to load in your USB loader.
					</li>
					<li>I recommend using <a href="https://tinypng.com">TinyPNG</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Launch CustomizeMii and open your base WAD.</li>
				<li>
					Select the "Banner" tab and then select "MenuScreen.tpl". Then select
					"Replace" and choose the image you want the banner to have.
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you want to add your own music, select the "Options" tab, select
						"Browse" under "New Sound" and then "Load Audio File".
					</li>
					<li>
						Your audio file must be in .wav format and for best results, it
						should also have only one audio channel and be under at 15 seconds.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Select "Create WAD" and save your WAD to your desired location.</li>
				<li>
					Open your new WAD in CustomizeMii and select the "Options" tab, select
					"Extract..." and then "WAD Contents". This will extract the WAD's
					content to a folder to your desired location.
				</li>
				<li>
					Locate the folder containing the WAD contents and then rename the file
					named <code>00000000.app</code> to <code>[GAME ID].bnr</code>.
					<ul>
						<li>
							You only need to have the first three characters of the game ID
							for USB Loader GX to read it properly.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				You should now see the banners you created with their respective title.

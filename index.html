					Heyo! My name is Snare-Hawk. I just wanted to make this site to make a
					collection of guides not currently found on
					<a href="https://wii.guide">Wii Guide</a>. Every guide on this site
					assumes that you at least have the
					<a href="https://wii.guide/get-started">Homebrew Channel</a> on your
					Wii. If you have any questions about anything regarding this site at
					all, don't be afraid to ping or DM me (Snare-Hawk#6331) on Discord;
					I'll likely be the server you found this link.

					Firstly, if you couldn't tell already, this site is heavily inspired
					by the amazing <a href="https://wii.guide">Wii Guide</a>. This site is
					the most reliable source for all things Wii and should be your go-to
					place for anything you may need. Furthermore, I'd like to thank the
					great minds at <a href="https://rc24.xyz">RiiConnect24</a> and
					<a href="https://github.com/MethodOrMadness">MethodOrMadness</a> for
					helping me learn all about Wii Homebrew. Without them, I wouldn't have
					been able to create these guides.
